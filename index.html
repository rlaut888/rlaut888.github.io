        <h2>Sophomore at Bob Jones University</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University studying computer science with a minor in mathematics. I work for the Computer Science department as a lab monitor.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy participating in community outreach events, and I am active in my local church: Southside Baptist Church of Gaffney, SC.  I teach Sunday School for the College &amp; Career group and I run the Sound / Video Projection System during services.  I also drive the church bus for weekend activities.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I also enjoy running / hiking as well as a good book
